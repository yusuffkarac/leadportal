Error: Could not find Prisma Schema that is required for this command.
You can either provide it with `--schema` argument,
set it in your Prisma Config file (e.g., `prisma.config.ts`),
set it as `prisma.schema` in your package.json,
or put it into the default location (`./prisma/schema.prisma`, or `./schema.prisma`.
Checked following paths:

schema.prisma: file not found
prisma/schema.prisma: file not found
